# The original version of Galaxtic (GLX)
Why didn't I upload this one instead?

## Why is it so big?
Everything has it's own class, or function. Paragraphs, hyperlinks, and headers have their own class. Styles have their own headers.
In the smaller version of Galaxtic (Which is the one you are recommended to download), everything is an exported function.

## Why didn't you upload this one instead?
Because I accidentally deleted this one, having to restart the project. So this isn't technically the original Galaxtic, but it's very close.

## Why is everything seperated into its own files?
It's easier to edit everything if it's not jumbled into a single file. Not that this is better anyways.

## What are the advantages of using this version of Galaxtic other than the smaller/compiled version?
Nothing. The compiled version is much smaller and easier to use. This one is just a bunch of spaghetti code I copy pasted from the compiled version since I accidentally
deleted the original one. Though the original Galaxtic (The one I deleted) was actually more efficient than the compiled one.

## Will we ever see the original version of Galaxtic?
No.
