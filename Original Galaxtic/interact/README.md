# Interact
Interactable HTML.

## What is Interactable HTML?
This file contains all available interactable HTML options we have, unless you want to use the html() function.

## Why seperate it into a different file?
I needed things to be more organized for my sake, so I seperated interactables, since they might need more than just a name and style. They could also need a HREF, a callback function, etc.
